# telegram-openai-chatbot

This is a template for me to create telegram bots using openai's gpt API. Currently, it is set to use the gpt-4 model, but you can change it to use any of the other models. You just connect it to your telegram bot and it will work. If you need it to work with group chats, remember to set the privacy mode to disabled with `@BotFather`.

This uses MongoDB to store the chat history and the user's data.
